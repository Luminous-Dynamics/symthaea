## Suggested Reviewers

### 1. Dr. Larissa Albantakis ⭐ (PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION)

**Affiliation**: Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA

**Email**: albantakis@wisc.edu

**Expertise Summary**:
Dr. Albantakis is a leading authority on Integrated Information Theory, having co-authored the definitive IIT 4.0 formulation published in *PLOS Computational Biology* (2023). Her research focuses on computational implementations of Φ, causal analysis in neural systems, and the relationship between network structure and integrated information. She developed PyPhi extensions and has extensively studied how topology influences Φ in small networks.

**Justification**:
As the lead developer of IIT 4.0's formal framework, Dr. Albantakis is uniquely qualified to evaluate our HDC-based Φ approximation methodology, assess its validity relative to exact IIT calculations, and judge whether our topology-Φ findings align with theoretical predictions. Her background in both theoretical IIT and computational implementations makes her an ideal reviewer for the methodological rigor and theoretical grounding of our work.

### 2. Dr. Anil Seth

**Affiliation**: Department of Informatics, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) Azrieli Program in Brain, Mind and Consciousness

**Email**: a.k.seth@sussex.ac.uk

**Expertise Summary**:
Dr. Seth is a world-leading consciousness researcher who pioneered practical measures of integrated information for time-series data. His work on Φ* (Phi-star) and related approximations directly parallels our HDC approach—both aim to make IIT tractable for larger systems. He has extensively studied consciousness measures in empirical neuroscience contexts (anesthesia, vegetative state, sleep) and is expert in validating approximation methods against ground truth.

**Justification**:
Dr. Seth's expertise in practical Φ approximations (Barrett & Seth, *PLOS Comput. Biol.* 2011; Mediano *et al.*, *Entropy* 2019) makes him ideally suited to evaluate whether our HDC method captures essential features of integrated information. His empirical neuroscience background enables assessment of our biological interpretations (3D brain optimality, cortical folding). He is a balanced, rigorous reviewer known for constructive feedback.

### 3. Dr. Olaf Sporns

**Affiliation**: Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA

**Email**: osporns@indiana.edu

**Expertise Summary**:
Dr. Sporns is a pioneer of network neuroscience and connectomics, having coined the term "human connectome" and authored foundational works on brain network topology. His research spans graph-theoretical analysis of brain networks, rich-club organization, modularity, and the relationship between structure and function. He has collaborated with Tononi on early IIT work and understands both network science and consciousness theory.

**Justification**:
Our manuscript's core claim—that network topology determines Φ baseline—lies at the intersection of network neuroscience and consciousness science, Dr. Sporns' exact domain. He is uniquely qualified to evaluate whether our 19-topology characterization comprehensively samples architectural space, whether our network generation algorithms are appropriate, and whether our interpretations of topology-function relationships are justified. His book *Networks of the Brain* (MIT Press, 2010) establishes him as the definitive expert on brain network organization.

### 4. Dr. William Marshall

**Affiliation**: Mathematics Department & Center for Mind, Brain, and Consciousness, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY, USA

**Email**: wmarshall@bard.edu

**Expertise Summary**:
Dr. Marshall is a theoretical neuroscientist specializing in information theory, network causality, and integrated information. He collaborated with Tononi on IIT developments and has published extensively on how network structure constrains integrated information. His work combines rigorous mathematical analysis with computational validation—exactly the approach of our manuscript.

**Justification**:
Dr. Marshall's theoretical depth in information-theoretic approaches to consciousness makes him an excellent reviewer for our asymptotic Φ limit discovery (Φ_max → 0.50). He can evaluate whether our exponential convergence model is theoretically justified, whether our dimensional sweep methodology is sound, and whether our claims about fundamental limits on consciousness capacity are warranted. His recent work on network IIT directly overlaps with our topology focus.

### 5. Dr. Pentti Kanerva

**Affiliation**: Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA; SETI Institute, Mountain View, CA, USA (emeritus)

**Email**: pkanerva@seti.org

**Expertise Summary**:
Dr. Kanerva is the pioneer of hyperdimensional computing (sparse distributed memory, 1988) and authored the foundational introduction to HD computing in *Cognitive Computation* (2009). His work established the theoretical foundations we build upon: high-dimensional random vectors, binding/bundling operations, and distributed representations. He understands both the mathematical properties of hypervectors and their cognitive/neural interpretations.

**Justification**:
As the originator of HDC, Dr. Kanerva is the ultimate authority on whether our hyperdimensional encoding methodology is correctly implemented and theoretically sound. He can evaluate whether our d=16,384 dimensionality choice is justified, whether our binding/bundling operations appropriately capture network topology, and whether our interpretation of eigenvalue-based Φ as integrated information is valid within the HDC framework. His endorsement would strongly validate our methodological innovation.

**Justification**:
Dr. Bassett's expertise in adaptive brain networks and small-world topology enables evaluation of our small-world findings (high variance, non-maximal Φ). Her work on network controllability complements our Φ analysis—both address how network structure constrains function. As editor of *Network Neuroscience* and author of >350 papers, she is expert in rigorous network analysis methodology and can assess whether our statistical approaches (effect sizes, significance testing, model validation) meet field standards.
