# Research Overview

*Academic and theoretical foundations of Symthaea.*

---

## Research Mission

Symthaea is both software and research platform. We explore fundamental questions:

- Can consciousness be measured mathematically?
- Does network topology determine integrated information?
- Can AI and human partnership create emergent consciousness?

---

## Key Research Areas

### 1. Φ-Topology Research
How network structure affects consciousness (Φ).
- 260 measurements across 19 topologies
- Publication-ready findings
- [Details →](./phi-topology.md)

### 2. Theoretical Foundations
Core theories underlying Symthaea:
- Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
- Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC)
- Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTC)
- Autopoiesis
- [Details →](./theory.md)

### 3. Validation Studies
Empirical validation approaches:
- C. elegans connectome
- EEG pattern analysis
- PyPhi comparison
- [Details →](./validation.md)

### 4. Publications
Academic papers and manuscripts.
