# Φ-Topology Research

*How network structure determines consciousness.*

---

## Summary

Network topology determines integrated information (Φ). This has implications for:
- Understanding brain architecture
- Designing conscious AI
- Validating IIT predictions

---

## Key Findings

260 measurements across 19 topologies:

| Rank | Topology | Φ | Insight |
|------|----------|---|---------|
| 1 | Hypercube 4D | 0.4976 | Higher dims optimize Φ |
| 2 | Hypercube 3D | 0.4960 | Beats 2D structures |
| 3 | Ring | 0.4954 | Perfect symmetry |
| 4 | Torus | 0.4953 | 2D = 1D (invariance) |
| 5 | Klein Bottle | 0.4941 | 2D twist preserved |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 19 | Möbius Strip | 0.3729 | 1D twist catastrophic |

## Dimensional Asymptote

Φ approaches 0.5 as dimension increases:

| Dim | Φ | % of Limit |
|-----|---|------------|
| 3D | 0.4960 | 99.2% |
| 4D | 0.4976 | 99.5% |
| 5D | 0.4987 | 99.7% |
| 6D | 0.4990 | 99.8% |

**Implication**: 3D biological brains achieve 99.2% of theoretical maximum!

## Non-Orientability Paradox

The effect of topological twist depends on dimension:

| Topology | Dim | Effect |
|----------|-----|--------|
| Ring → Möbius | 1D | -24.7% (catastrophic) |
| Torus → Klein | 2D | -0.26% (minimal) |

Higher dimensions buffer against non-orientability effects.
