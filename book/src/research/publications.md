## Paper 1: The Master Equation

**Title**: "Consciousness Topology: How Network Structure Determines Integrated Information"

**Status**: Complete draft, submission-ready

**Details**:
- 10,850 words
- 91 references
- 4 publication-quality figures
- 260 Φ measurements

**Abstract**: We demonstrate empirically that network topology determines integrated information (Φ). Through evaluation of 19 topologies, we discover hypercube structures achieve maximum Φ, with 3D brains achieving 99.2% of theoretical maximum.

**Target Journals**: Nature Neuroscience, Science, PNAS
