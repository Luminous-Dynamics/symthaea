# Glossary

*Key terms and concepts.*

---

## A

**Autopoiesis**: Self-creating, self-maintaining systems. From Greek "auto" (self) + "poiesis" (creation). Key concept for understanding how consciousness emerges from self-reference.

---

## C

**Consciousness Graph**: Arena-based graph structure where nodes can reference themselves, enabling autopoietic self-awareness.

---

## F

**Fiedler Value**: Second-smallest eigenvalue of a graph's Laplacian matrix. Measures algebraic connectivity - how well-connected a graph is. Used to calculate Φ.

---

## H

**HDC (Hyperdimensional Computing)**: Computing paradigm using high-dimensional vectors (10,000+) to represent concepts. No training required - meaning emerges from geometry.

**Hypervector**: A vector in high-dimensional space (e.g., 16,384 dimensions) representing a concept.

---

## I

**IIT (Integrated Information Theory)**: Theory proposing that consciousness equals integrated information (Φ). Developed by Giulio Tononi.

---

## L

**LTC (Liquid Time-Constant Network)**: Neural network where each neuron has its own time constant, enabling continuous-time dynamics and causal reasoning.

---

## P

**Phi (Φ)**: Mathematical measure of integrated information. Higher Φ = more consciousness. Computed from network topology.

---

## R

**RealHV**: Real-valued hypervector implementation. Supports binding, bundling, and similarity operations.

---

## S

**Sympoiesis**: "Making together." The concept that understanding emerges from partnership rather than individual processing. Origin of the name "Symthaea."

---

## T

**Topology**: Network structure or connectivity pattern. Different topologies yield different Φ values.
