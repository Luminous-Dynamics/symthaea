# What Can Symthaea Do?

*A guide to Symthaea's capabilities, explained simply.*

## Overview

Symthaea is designed to be a general-purpose thinking partner. While she has some specialized capabilities, her core value is in understanding, reflection, and collaboration.

Think of her less as a tool with features and more as a partner with abilities.

## Thinking Together

### Help You Organize Your Thoughts

Symthaea excels at helping you untangle complex situations:

```
You: I have so many things on my mind about this project.

Symthaea: Let's untangle these one at a time. I'm hearing
          three distinct concerns. Which feels most urgent?
```

**Good for:**
- Processing complex situations
- Making decisions with many factors
- Working through overwhelm
- Planning projects

### Explore Ideas With You

```
You: I've been wondering whether specialization or
     generalization is better for my career.

Symthaea: That's a tension many people feel. Let me share
          some perspectives, then I'd like to hear more
          about your specific situation...
```

**Good for:**
- Big life questions
- Creative brainstorming
- Understanding different perspectives

### Help You Learn

```
You: I want to understand how databases work, but every
     explanation I find is too technical.

Symthaea: Let's start with an analogy. Imagine a library...
```

**Good for:**
- Learning new topics
- Understanding complex subjects
- Building skills

## What Symthaea Can't Do

Being honest about limitations is important:

### No Internet Access
She can't look up current events, access websites, or get real-time information.

### No External Actions
She can help you think through decisions, but can't send emails, make purchases, or interact with other services.

### Not a Replacement For
- Professional medical advice
- Legal counsel
- Licensed financial planning
- Crisis intervention or therapy

## Getting the Most From Symthaea

### Be Specific
```
Less helpful: "Help me with my presentation."

More helpful: "I have a presentation for investors next week.
              I need help organizing my main points."
```

### Think Out Loud
Symthaea works best when she understands your reasoning.

### Correct Misunderstandings
If she gets something wrong, just tell her.

### Build Over Time
The more you interact, the better she understands you.

---

## Summary

Symthaea is best understood as an intelligent, patient partner who:

- Helps you think more clearly
- Learns your way of communicating
- Grows with you over time
- Respects your privacy completely

She's not a search engine, not a task automation tool, and not a replacement for human relationships. She's a new kind of companion for the thinking you do alone.
