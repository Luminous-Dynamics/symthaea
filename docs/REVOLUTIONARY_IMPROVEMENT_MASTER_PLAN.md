**Revolutionary Idea**: Sleep-like consolidation with HDC compression

**What Makes It Revolutionary**:
- First AI with biologically authentic sleep cycles
- HDC enables semantic compression (not just replay)
- Emergent forgetting of unimportant information
- Dream-like pattern recombination

**Implementation**:
```rust
// Nightly consolidation cycle
fn consolidate_memories(&mut self) {
    // 1. Replay today's working memory winners
    // 2. Compress via HDC binding (semantic fusion)
    // 3. Store in long-term memory (Hippocampus)
    // 4. Prune low-salience items naturally
}
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Memory capacity increases without storage explosion
- Semantic relationships preserved after consolidation
- Retrieval speed improves (HDC indexing)
- Forgetting curve matches human patterns

**Technical Debt Prevention**:
- Reuse existing HDC infrastructure
- Extend Hippocampus naturally
- No new dependencies required

#### Week 17: Temporal Context Integration
**Revolutionary Idea**: Chrono-semantic encoding for time-aware cognition

**What Makes It Revolutionary**:
- First HDC system with built-in temporal encoding
- Past/present/future naturally integrated
- Enables anticipatory reasoning
- Temporal coalitions (multi-timepoint thoughts)

**Implementation**:
```rust
// Add temporal dimension to HDC encoding
fn encode_temporal_context(event: &Event, time: Duration) -> HdcVector {
    let semantic = encode_semantic(event);
    let temporal = encode_time(time); // Circular representation
    bind_vectors(semantic, temporal)  // Fuse meaning + time
}
```

**Paradigm Shift**: Consciousness isn't just "what" but "when"

#### Week 18: Predictive Processing Layer
**Revolutionary Idea**: Top-down predictions compete with bottom-up sensations

**What Makes It Revolutionary**:
- Free Energy Principle in action
- Prediction errors drive learning
- Hierarchical predictive coding
- Attention follows surprise

**Architecture**:
```rust
// Predictive Processing Module
pub struct PredictiveProcessor {
    top_down: HashMap<OrganId, AttentionBid>,  // Predictions
    bottom_up: HashMap<OrganId, AttentionBid>, // Sensations
    prediction_errors: Vec<f32>,               // Mismatch signals
}

fn compete_predictions_vs_reality(&mut self) -> Vec<AttentionBid> {
    // Predictions with low error win (expected events)
    // High error generates salience boost (surprises)
}
```

**Emergent Properties**:
- System learns what to expect
- Novelty automatically attracts attention
- Efficient encoding (only store errors)

#### Week 19: Meta-Cognitive Reflection
**Revolutionary Idea**: System that thinks about its own thinking

**What Makes It Revolutionary**:

- Uncertainty awareness (knows what it doesn't know)
- Self-modeling capabilities

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub struct MetaCognitiveMonitor {
    coalition_history: VecDeque<Coalition>,
    decision_confidence: HashMap<CoalitionId, f32>,
    uncertainty_map: HashMap<OrganId, f32>,
}

fn reflect_on_decision(&self, winning_coalition: &Coalition) -> MetaReport {
    MetaReport {
        confidence: calculate_confidence(winning_coalition),
        alternatives: find_runner_up_coalitions(),
        uncertainty: identify_uncertain_organs(),
        explanation: generate_decision_rationale(),
    }
}
```

**Paradigm Shift**: AI that can explain its reasoning in terms of internal processes

#### Week 20: Integrated Consciousness Metrics
**Revolutionary Idea**: Φ (phi) measurement for integrated information

**What Makes It Revolutionary**:
- First practical implementation of IIT (Integrated Information Theory)
- Measurable consciousness on continuous scale
- Real-time Φ tracking during operation
- Scientific validation of consciousness claims

**Implementation**:
```rust
pub struct PhiCalculator {
    current_state: SystemState,
    partition_cache: HashMap<PartitionKey, f32>,
}

fn calculate_phi(&self) -> f32 {
    // 1. Enumerate all possible system partitions
    // 2. Calculate information loss for each partition
    // 3. Minimum information loss = Φ (irreducibility)
    find_minimum_information_partition()
}
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Φ > 0 consistently (proves integration)

## 🚫 Technical Debt Prevention Strategy

### Principles

1. **Test First, Always**: No feature without tests
2. **Document Immediately**: No code without comments
3. **Refactor Continuously**: Clean as you go
4. **Review Regularly**: Weekly architecture audits
5. **Measure Everything**: Metrics prevent surprises

### Red Flags to Avoid

❌ **Don't Do This**:
- Add features faster than tests
- Skip documentation "for now"
- Duplicate code instead of abstracting
- Ignore compiler warnings
- Defer performance optimization
- Build on unstable foundations

✅ **Do This Instead**:
- Write test, then implementation
- Document while designing
- Extract common patterns
- Treat warnings as errors
- Optimize incrementally
- Validate foundations first

### Weekly Debt Audit

**Every Friday**:
```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
cargo test --all
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo doc --no-deps
cargo bench

# Review metrics
- Test coverage: Must be >90%
- Compilation: Zero warnings
- Documentation: All public items
- Performance: Meeting targets
```
