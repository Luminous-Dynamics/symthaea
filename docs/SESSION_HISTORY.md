# Phi-Lab Session History

*Archived session achievements - see CLAUDE.md for current status*

## Session 9 (Dec 28, 2025) - Dimensional Sweep + Full Manuscript

**Achievements**:
- Full 1D-7D dimensional sweep (70 samples)
- Discovered asymptotic limit: Phi -> 0.5

- Complete journal-ready manuscript (10,850 words, 91 refs, 4 figures)

**Key Finding**: 3D brains achieve 99.2% of theoretical maximum

## Session 8 (Dec 27, 2025) - Fractal Breakthrough

- Sierpinski Gasket achieves Phi = 0.4957 (new champion)
- Confirmed self-similarity benefit (+2.08% vs Binary Tree)
- Fractal dimension alone doesn't determine Phi

## Session 7 (Dec 27, 2025) - Tier 3 Implementation

- Implemented Fractal, Hypercube 3D/4D, Quantum topologies
- Complete 19-topology system

## Session 6 (Dec 27, 2025) - Tier 2 + Dimensional Breakthrough

- Klein Bottle paradox discovered (2D twist preserves Phi)
- Hypercube 4D beats all 18 previous topologies
- Dimensional invariance extends to 4D

## Session 5 (Dec 27, 2025) - Resonator Phi
