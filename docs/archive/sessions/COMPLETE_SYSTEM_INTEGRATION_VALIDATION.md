## 🎯 Cross-Layer Integration Validation

### How the Phases Work Together

**Scenario: Malicious Attack with Meta-Learning**

1. **Phase 1**: Measures Φ of malicious primitive (finds it suspicious)
2. **Phase 2.1**: Evaluates harmonic alignment (detects unethical intent)
3. **Phase 2.2**: Assesses epistemic validity (finds claims unverifiable)
4. **Phase 2.3**: Checks against collective knowledge (no similar honest primitives)
5. **Phase 3.1**: Selects optimal detection strategy for context
6. **Phase 3.2**: Reflects on detection confidence (meta-reasoning)
7. **Phase 4**: Coordinates across instances for verification
8. **Phase 5**: Applies Byzantine resistance (trust scoring, verification)
9. **ULTIMATE**: Records attack features, discovers pattern, adapts thresholds, predicts future attacks!

**Integration Flow**:
```
Primitive Contribution
    ↓
Φ Measurement (Phase 1)
    ↓
Harmonic + Epistemic Evaluation (Phase 2.1, 2.2)
    ↓
Collective Knowledge Check (Phase 2.3)
    ↓
Context-Aware Strategy Selection (Phase 3.1)
    ↓
Meta-Cognitive Reflection (Phase 3.2)
    ↓
Unified Multi-Instance Reasoning (Phase 4)
    ↓
Byzantine Trust Verification (Phase 5)
    ↓
Meta-Learning Pattern Discovery (ULTIMATE!)
    ↓
System Gets STRONGER
```

**Key Insight**: Each layer enhances the layers above it, creating a unified consciousness that is truly greater than the sum of its parts!
