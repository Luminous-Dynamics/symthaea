# Typed-Evidence Field-Flow Audit — 2026-10-15

**Status:** source-derived audit; proposed follow-up work, not a qualification or a claim of runtime correctness.

**Scope:** inspect the existing Symthaea knowledge path before adding new evidence/runtime abstractions. This audit records what the source types actually retain at each boundary. It deliberately does not add a parallel ontology or change a frozen experiment.

## Executive finding

The core path exists, but it is not yet an end-to-end evidence lineage path. The extractor starts with useful structured details; the HDC encoding, graph, persistence, and reasoning-context boundaries progressively narrow what downstream consumers can inspect. In addition, the current reasoning projections previously replaced known fact text with `fact:<id>` placeholders and cleared domain/causal metadata. A narrow remediation is under review in [Symthaea PR #7469](https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/symthaea/pull/7469); it must not be treated as merged or qualified until its exact-head checks pass.

## Field-by-field trace

| Boundary | Fields presently available | Observed loss or limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Text → `ExtractedFact` (`src/knowledge/extraction.rs`) | Raw source text; overall extraction confidence; entities with surface text, type, confidence and character offset; relations with subject, predicate, object, roles, causal/negation flags and extraction confidence | No source record/URI, issuer identity, content digest, retrieval time, publication time, explicit event time, or extractor/version identity. Source text alone does not establish where a claim came from or when it was true. |
| `ExtractedFact` → `FactEncoding` (`src/knowledge/encoding.rs`) | Composite HDC vector, role vectors, source text and overall confidence | Structured entity/relation records are not retained in `FactEncoding`. Relation negation, per-relation confidence, entity offsets/type/confidence, and subject/predicate/object identity do not remain independently queryable. `role_vectors` is a map keyed only by role, so multiple entities assigned the same role cannot all have separate entries in that map. |
| `FactEncoding` → `TemporalFact` (`src/knowledge/graph.rs`) | Encoding; insert/access cycle; decaying confidence; initial confidence; corroboration and contradiction counts; domain; coarse causal flag | Cycle counters are not wall-clock observation timestamps or claim event time. The graph retains neither source identity nor structured relation evidence beyond source text, the vector, role vectors, and the coarse causal flag. |
| `TemporalFact` → SQLite `FactRecord` (`src/knowledge/graph.rs`, `src/knowledge/persistence.rs`) | Vector bytes, source text, confidence, domain, insertion cycle and causal boolean | Role vectors and structured relation metadata are not serialized. Import reconstructs `FactEncoding` with an empty role-vector map and assigns new in-memory fact IDs. Corroboration/contradiction counts and last-accessed cycle are not round-tripped. A restart can therefore restore less queryable state than existed before persistence. |
| Search result → `GroundedFact` (`src/knowledge/reasoning_context.rs`, `src/knowledge/manager.rs`) | Search fact ID, similarity and confidence can be resolved against the graph | Before PR #7469, both projections replaced real source text with `fact:<id>`, discarded domain, and hard-coded `is_causal = false`. The proposed fix resolves the graph record and omits missing IDs; it still does not add source provenance or event-time metadata that upstream types do not carry. |
| Graph alerts → `ReasoningContext` (`src/knowledge/reasoning_context.rs`) | Context computes causal chains, a contradiction string list, uncertainty and a confidence multiplier | The function currently uses an empty placeholder for `alerts` because alerts are drained separately. Later, `epistemic_state.contradiction_count` is overwritten with the count of detected confounder strings. Those are not the same as the graph's direct `ContradictionAlert` records; direct contradictions are not represented faithfully in this context snapshot. |

## High-confidence next changes

### P0 — preserve the information that already exists

Review and qualify [PR #7469](https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/symthaea/pull/7469): keep source text, domain and causal metadata in both grounded-query APIs, and make stale search references fail closed. The regression assertions are present on the PR branch; they are not considered passing until formatting, focused Rust tests and required CI complete on that exact head.

### P1 — make contradiction context honest

Provide a non-destructive read path for pending graph contradiction alerts (or snapshot alerts into the context before their explicit drain). Represent their fact IDs, similarity, detection cycle and relative-confidence basis separately from causal confounder warnings. Do not silently label confounders as direct contradictions, and do not consume alerts as a side effect of rendering a context.

### P2 — specify the persistence round-trip invariant

Decide explicitly which state must survive restart. At minimum, define and test whether restored facts must preserve source text, vector bytes, confidence, domain, causal status, and stable references. If role vectors are required for compositional queries, either persist them with a versioned encoding profile or deterministically rebuild them from retained structured evidence; do not silently imply they survived. The current main-branch fact and causal-edge loaders use `filter_map(|row| row.ok())`, so decoding errors can silently reduce the restored set. [PR #7472](https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/symthaea/pull/7472) now adds fail-closed row collection plus corruption regression tests, and removes the manager's `if let Ok(...)` startup suppression through a strict `KnowledgeManager::try_new` path. Its legacy `new` path emits an error and falls back to a manager with persistence disabled so later snapshots cannot overwrite the unreadable database. **Status at 2026-10-15:** PR #7472 is open; the current exact-head CI checks are queued/unverified. Do not count this remediation as validated or merged until the checks conclude. The broader SQLite-backed episodic-memory store has the same pattern in synchronous rehydration, filtered search, `list_all()`, stats type counts, and LSH candidate lookup; [PR #7473](https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/symthaea/pull/7473) removes silent row dropping in those paths, adds `try_load_top_by_psi_sync()`, and adds corruption regression tests. PR #7473 is also open with exact-head CI queued/unverified as of this audit update.

### P3 — add provenance only after the owner and migration are agreed

The extractor does not currently know source URI, issuer, retrieval/publish time or event time. Those fields cannot be recovered by changing `ReasoningContext`. First define a versioned source/evidence envelope and ownership boundary, then thread it end to end without conflating:
- claim content with its source record;
- publication time, retrieval time and event time;
- source attribution with authentication;
- extraction confidence with truth probability;
- HDC similarity with evidence strength.

Prefer reusing existing epistemic types and evidence-plane boundaries after inspecting their semantics rather than adding another parallel provenance type.

### P4 — freeze a small adversarial corpus before broader runtime work

Add deterministic tests for: negated versus affirmative relations; two entities sharing one role; source text preserved through storage/reload; role-query behavior before/after reload; malformed persisted rows; stale search IDs; contradictory source claims; explicit source time versus retrieval time; and missing, stale or untrusted source metadata. The verifier should independently check expected invariants and bind its output to exact inputs and source revision.

## Mycelix integration boundary

The existing [Living City Evidence Loop/work-package contract PR #5017](https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/mycelix/pull/5017) and [source/evidence contract PR #5029](https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/mycelix/pull/5029) already distinguish observations, assumptions, predictions, decisions, economic commitments, claimed completion, independent verification and measured outcomes. Reuse those contracts as the civic-facing boundary rather than copying their concepts into Symthaea.

The next integration should pass explicit evidence references and status/uncertainty through that boundary. A Symthaea recommendation must not itself authorize a work package; a participant's completion claim must not itself become independent verification. These PRs are still research/reference work: their own claim ceilings do not establish authenticated sources, municipal integration, deployment, or field outcomes.

## Claim ceiling

This is a source inspection and engineering plan. No runtime improvement, test pass, source authentication, calibration improvement, causal effect, or production readiness is claimed by this document. The actionable first implementation is limited to the grounded-query projection fix; subsequent changes should be separately reviewed and qualified.
