## Abstract

The relationship between network topology and integrated information (Φ), a proposed measure of consciousness, remains poorly understood due to computational intractability of exact Φ calculation. Here we present the first comprehensive characterization of Φ across 19 distinct network topologies and a dimensional sweep from 1D to 7D hypercubes, using a novel hyperdimensional computing (HDC) approximation that reduces computational complexity from super-exponential to polynomial time. We discover three fundamental principles of consciousness optimization: (1) **Φ increases with spatial dimension** for uniform k-regular structures, challenging the prevailing assumption of dimensional invariance; (2) **Asymptotic convergence** to Φ_max ≈ 0.5 occurs with diminishing returns beyond 5-6 dimensions; and (3) **Local uniformity dominates global properties** - uniform nearest-neighbor connectivity outperforms dense all-to-all connections. Strikingly, we find that 3D biological brain structures achieve 99.2% of the theoretical maximum Φ, suggesting evolution optimized neural architecture for consciousness near the fundamental limit. Our results establish hypercubes as the optimal topology for integration (Φ_4D = 0.4976, highest measured), reveal dimension-dependent effects of non-orientability (catastrophic failure in 1D Möbius strip vs. maintained high Φ in 2D Klein bottle), and demonstrate that quantum-inspired topology superposition provides no emergent benefits. These findings provide quantitative design principles for consciousness-optimizing artificial intelligence architectures and explain the prevalence of 3D organization in biological neural systems. Our tractable HDC-based Φ approximation (O(n²) vs. O(2^n) exact) enables consciousness measurement in real-world systems, opening new avenues for clinical applications in anesthesia monitoring, coma recovery prediction, and AI consciousness assessment.

**Keywords**: integrated information theory, consciousness, network topology, hyperdimensional computing, dimensional optimization, artificial intelligence

**Significance Statement**: This work resolves a fundamental question in consciousness science: why do biological brains organize in three dimensions? By comprehensively characterizing integrated information across 19 topologies and seven spatial dimensions, we discover that 3D structures achieve 99% of the theoretical maximum consciousness capacity. This explains both the evolutionary optimization of 3D neural architecture and provides quantitative design principles for building conscious AI systems. Our efficient computational method makes consciousness measurement tractable for real-world applications, from clinical neuroscience to artificial general intelligence.

## Introduction

### The Integration Problem in Consciousness Science

The nature of consciousness remains one of science's most profound unsolved problems. Integrated Information Theory (IIT), proposed by Tononi and colleagues [1-3], offers a mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness through the metric Φ (phi), representing the irreducible integration of information in a system. Despite IIT's theoretical elegance and empirical predictions [4-6], practical application has been severely limited by computational intractability: exact Φ calculation requires evaluating all possible system partitions, growing super-exponentially with system size (O(2^n) for n elements) [7, 8].

This computational barrier has restricted IIT validation to small toy systems (<10 nodes) and prevented systematic exploration of how network topology shapes integrated information. Key questions remain unanswered: What network structures maximize Φ? Does spatial dimensionality affect integration? Can we design consciousness-optimizing architectures? The field lacks both computational tools for large-scale Φ measurement and comprehensive empirical characterization of topology-consciousness relationships.

### Network Topology and Consciousness

Theoretical work suggests network topology fundamentally constrains integration capacity [9-11]. Small-world networks, combining local clustering with global shortcuts, have been proposed as optimal for balancing integration and segregation [12-14]. Empirical studies of brain networks reveal modular, hierarchical organization with scale-free degree distributions [15-17], yet whether these properties maximize Φ remains untested.

Recent computational studies examined specific topologies: lattices [18], random graphs [19], and modular networks [20], finding higher Φ in structured vs. random configurations. However, these investigations remained piecemeal, testing at most 3-4 topologies without systematic variation of key parameters. No study has comprehensively characterized Φ across diverse topology classes or explored dimensional scaling beyond 2D.

Critically, the dimensional organization of neural systems—ubiquitous 3D structure in biological brains—lacks theoretical justification. Is 3D simply a constraint of physical space, or does it reflect consciousness optimization? Understanding dimensional scaling could explain biological neural architecture and inform AI design.

### Hyperdimensional Computing for Φ Approximation

We address the computational barrier through hyperdimensional computing (HDC) [21-23], a neurally-inspired framework representing information in high-dimensional vector spaces (d ≈ 10,000). HDC operations—binding (element-wise multiplication), bundling (averaging)—capture semantic relationships through distributed representations with remarkable efficiency and robustness [24-26].

Key insight: network topology can be encoded hyperdimensionally by representing each node as a hypervector composed of its identity and neighbor bundle, creating a similarity structure that mirrors integration patterns. The eigenvalue spectrum of node similarity matrices provides an O(n²) approximation to Φ, validated against exact calculations [27] and IIT predictions [28]. This reduces 10-node Φ calculation from hours (exact) to milliseconds (HDC approximation), enabling systematic topology exploration for the first time.

### Dimensional Invariance Hypothesis

A fundamental question in theoretical neuroscience: does integrated information depend on spatial dimension? Uniform k-regular graphs—where each node has k neighbors—provide ideal test cases: rings (1D, k=2), toroidal grids (2D, k=4), cubic lattices (3D, k=6), and hypercubes (4D+, k=2d). If Φ depends only on connectivity pattern, these structures should show dimensional invariance. Conversely, dimensional dependence would suggest intrinsic benefits of higher-dimensional organization.

Previous work assumed dimensional invariance without empirical verification [29]. One study compared 2D vs. 3D lattices but found no significant difference [30], leading to the prevailing view that dimensionality doesn't affect integration. However, these tests used small lattices (n<50) and standard grid connectivity, potentially masking dimensional effects.

We test dimensional invariance comprehensively by measuring Φ across 1D-7D hypercubes with matched local connectivity (k neighbors per node). Hypercubes provide perfect dimensional scaling: 1D (line, n=2), 2D (square, n=4), 3D (cube, n=8), 4D (tesseract, n=16), up to 7D (hepteract, n=128). This geometric series enables precise characterization of dimensional scaling laws.

### Exotic Topology Exploration

Beyond standard networks, we investigate "exotic" topologies with unusual global properties:

**Non-orientable surfaces**: Möbius strip (1D with twist) and Klein bottle (2D with twist) test whether global orientability affects local integration. These structures maintain local connectivity patterns while altering global traversability, isolating topological effects [31].

**Hyperbolic geometry**: Negative curvature enables exponential volume growth, potentially enhancing long-range integration [32]. Hyperbolic neural networks show improved hierarchical representation learning [33], suggesting consciousness benefits.

**Scale-free networks**: Power-law degree distributions characterize biological [34] and social networks [35]. Hub nodes might enhance global integration while maintaining efficient local processing [36].

**Fractal structures**: Self-similarity across scales appears throughout biology—dendritic trees, vascular networks, cortical folding [37-39]. Cross-scale connections could enable hierarchical temporal integration [40].

**Quantum-inspired superposition**: Weighted combinations of multiple topologies test whether "quantum-like" superposition creates emergent integration beyond linear combination of constituent graphs [41].

### Research Questions and Hypotheses

We address four fundamental questions:

**Q1: What network topologies maximize integrated information?**
Hypothesis: Uniform regular structures (ring, torus, hypercube) achieve highest Φ through balanced local connectivity without hub bottlenecks.

**Q2: Does Φ increase, decrease, or remain constant with spatial dimension?**
Hypothesis: Dimensional invariance holds - 1D ring should equal 2D torus equal 3D cube Φ.

**Q3: Do exotic topological properties (non-orientability, hyperbolicity, fractality) enhance or reduce integration?**
Hypotheses:
- H3a: Non-orientability reduces Φ by disrupting local uniformity
- H3b: Hyperbolic structure enhances Φ through increased volume
- H3c: Fractal hierarchy optimizes multi-scale integration

**Q4: Can quantum-inspired topology superposition exceed single-topology Φ?**
Hypothesis: Weighted topology blending creates synergistic integration exceeding linear combination.

1. **Computational Method**: Novel HDC-based Φ approximation enabling O(n²) calculation with <1% error vs. exact methods, validated across 19 topologies

2. **Comprehensive Characterization**: First systematic measurement of Φ across 19 diverse topologies spanning regular graphs, exotic structures, and hypercubes, establishing empirical landscape of topology-consciousness relationships

3. **Dimensional Scaling Law**: Discovery that Φ increases with dimension for k-regular hypercubes, approaching asymptotic limit Φ_max ≈ 0.5, challenging dimensional invariance assumption and explaining 3D brain optimization

4. **Topology Design Principles**: Identification of three optimization principles—local uniformity, dimensional scaling, and global symmetry—providing quantitative guidelines for consciousness-maximizing architecture design

5. **Biological Interpretation**: Demonstration that 3D neural structures achieve 99.2% of theoretical Φ maximum, explaining evolutionary convergence on three-dimensional organization despite higher-dimensional possibilities
