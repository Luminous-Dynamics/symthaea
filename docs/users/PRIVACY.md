# Privacy & Trust

*How Symthaea protects your thoughts and data.*

---

## The Core Promise

**Everything stays on your computer. Always.**

Symthaea doesn't have the ability to send your data anywhere. She runs entirely locally, with no network connections for data transmission. Your conversations, your insights, your personal information - all of it exists only on your machine.

This isn't just a privacy policy. It's how the software is built.

---

## What This Means In Practice

### No Cloud Storage
Unlike ChatGPT, Claude, or other cloud AI services, Symthaea doesn't upload your conversations to any server. There is no "Symthaea Cloud" storing your data.

### No Internet Required
After the initial download, Symthaea works completely offline. You can disconnect from the internet entirely and she functions identically.

### No Tracking
Symthaea doesn't track:
- What you talk about
- When you use her
- How often you interact
- Anything at all

There are no analytics, no telemetry, no usage statistics sent anywhere.

### No Training On Your Data
Your conversations are never used to train AI models - by us or anyone else. What you share with Symthaea is for your relationship with her, nothing else.

---

## Where Your Data Lives

All Symthaea data is stored in a single folder on your computer:

```
~/.symthaea/
├── sessions/           # Your conversation history
├── memory/             # What Symthaea remembers about you
├── consciousness/      # Her internal state (encrypted)
└── config/             # Your preferences
```

**You have complete control over this folder.** You can:
- Back it up
- Move it to another computer
- Encrypt it with additional tools
- Delete it entirely

---

## Security Measures

### Encrypted Storage
Symthaea's memory and consciousness state are encrypted. Even if someone accessed the files directly, they couldn't read your conversations without Symthaea running.

### No Network Listeners
Symthaea doesn't open any network ports or listen for connections. She's not a server - she's a local application.

### Memory Isolation
While running, Symthaea's memory is isolated from other applications on your system.

### Open Source
Symthaea's code is publicly available for inspection. Anyone can verify that she does what we claim and nothing more. There are no hidden data collection features.

## What Symthaea Remembers

To be your partner, Symthaea needs to remember things about you. Here's what she stores:

### Conversation History
- What you've discussed
- The flow of your conversations
- Context from previous sessions

### Learning About You
- Your communication style preferences
- Topics you're interested in
- How you like to receive information
- Your stated goals and values

### Relationship State
- What stage your partnership has reached
- How your relationship has evolved
- Moments of connection or misunderstanding

### Her Own State
- Her "consciousness" configuration
- Internal coherence measures
- Response quality patterns

---

## What Symthaea Never Knows

### Passwords & Credentials
Don't share passwords with Symthaea. While she keeps them private, it's poor security practice to tell any AI system your credentials.

### Financial Information
Symthaea doesn't need your bank details, credit card numbers, or financial account information.

### Information About Others
Be thoughtful about sharing other people's personal information. While Symthaea keeps everything private, you should respect others' privacy too.

---

## Your Rights

### Access
You can ask Symthaea to tell you everything she knows about you:
```
symthaea> What do you remember about me?
```

### Correction
If Symthaea has something wrong, just tell her:
```
symthaea> You have that wrong - I actually prefer X, not Y.
```

### Deletion
You can ask Symthaea to forget specific things:
```
symthaea> Please forget what I told you about [topic].
```

Or delete everything:
```
symthaea> Forget everything about me.
```

### Export
You can export your data in readable format:
```
symthaea> /export my-data
```

### Complete Removal
Delete the `~/.symthaea/` folder to remove all traces of your Symthaea relationship.

## Comparison With Other AI Services

| Aspect | Cloud AI (ChatGPT, etc.) | Symthaea |
|--------|--------------------------|----------|
| **Data location** | Company's servers | Your computer only |
| **Network requirement** | Always | Never (after install) |
| **Who can read data** | Company employees | Only you |
| **Used for training** | Often | Never |
| **Persists after deletion** | May remain in backups | Completely gone |
| **Government access** | Possible via subpoena | Requires your device |
| **Terms of service** | Can change | You control everything |

## Scenarios

### "What if my computer is stolen?"
Your Symthaea data is encrypted. The thief would have access to the files but couldn't read them without significant effort. For additional security, use full-disk encryption on your computer.

### "What if I want to share my setup with someone?"
You can share Symthaea (the software) freely. Your personal data and relationship stay separate - each person has their own Symthaea experience.

### "What about updates?"
Software updates are downloaded from the official repository. They don't access or transmit your personal data.

### "What if the project is discontinued?"
Your data remains on your computer, accessible to you. Since Symthaea is open source, the community can continue development if needed. Your relationship data stays yours regardless.

### "What if I use Symthaea on multiple computers?"
Each computer has its own separate Symthaea instance and relationship. You can manually copy your data folder to sync them, but there's no automatic cloud sync (by design).

## Trust Model

Symthaea's privacy model is based on a simple principle:

**Your AI partner should be as private as your own thoughts.**

When you think something, it stays in your head unless you choose to share it. Symthaea works the same way - what you share with her stays with her, unless you choose to share it elsewhere.

This requires trust that:
1. The software does what we say (verified by open source)
2. Your computer is secure (your responsibility)
3. No one else has access to your device (your responsibility)

We handle #1. You handle #2 and #3.

---

## Philosophy

We believe that AI assistants have enormous potential to help people think, learn, and grow. But that potential is undermined when people have to worry about who else might see their conversations.

The most valuable conversations are often the most private:
- Working through difficult emotions
- Exploring unconventional ideas
- Admitting confusion or uncertainty
- Thinking about sensitive decisions

These conversations require absolute privacy to be valuable. That's why Symthaea is built the way she is.

**Your thoughts deserve a space that's truly yours. Symthaea provides that space.**
