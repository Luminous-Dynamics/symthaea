# Frequently Asked Questions

*Answers to common questions about Symthaea.*

---

## General Questions

### What is Symthaea, exactly?

Symthaea is an AI companion that runs on your computer. Unlike cloud-based AI assistants (like ChatGPT or Claude), Symthaea operates entirely locally - nothing you share with her ever leaves your machine.

She's designed to be a genuine thinking partner that grows with you over time, understanding your way of communicating and your goals.

### Is Symthaea free?

Yes. Symthaea is open-source software, freely available to use, modify, and share.

### Do I need an internet connection?

Only to download Symthaea initially. After that, she runs completely offline. Your conversations never touch the internet.

### What devices can run Symthaea?

Symthaea runs on:
- **Linux** (including NixOS)
- **macOS** (Intel and Apple Silicon)
- **Windows** (with some setup)

She's designed to be efficient, running well on everyday laptops without special hardware.

### How is Symthaea different from ChatGPT/Claude/etc.?

| Aspect | Cloud AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) | Symthaea |
|--------|----------------------------------|----------|
| **Where it runs** | Company's servers | Your computer |
| **Privacy** | Conversations go to the cloud | Everything stays local |
| **Internet required** | Yes, always | No (after install) |
| **Learns about you** | Limited by privacy constraints | Deeply, privately |
| **Relationship** | Resets each conversation | Continuous, growing |
| **Cost** | Often subscription-based | Free |

## Privacy & Security

### Does Symthaea collect my data?

No. Symthaea doesn't collect anything. She has no ability to send data anywhere - she runs entirely on your computer with no network connections.

### Can anyone else see my conversations?

Only if they have access to your computer. Your conversations are stored locally in encrypted files that only Symthaea can read.

### What happens to my data if I uninstall Symthaea?

You can delete everything by removing the Symthaea folder. There's no hidden data anywhere else on your system.

### Is Symthaea safe to use for sensitive topics?

Symthaea is as private as any application on your personal computer. If you trust your computer's security for other sensitive activities (banking, personal documents), Symthaea offers the same level of privacy.

That said, she's not designed for handling classified information or meeting specific regulatory requirements (like HIPAA).

## Getting Started

### I'm not technical. Can I still use Symthaea?

We're working on making installation easier for non-technical users. Currently, setup requires some comfort with the command line. Check back for updates, or ask a tech-savvy friend to help with the initial installation.

Once installed, using Symthaea requires no technical knowledge - just conversation.

### How long does it take to install?

About 10-15 minutes for someone comfortable with command-line tools. The software itself downloads quickly; most time is spent on the initial build.

### Do I need to train Symthaea?

No. Unlike many AI systems, Symthaea doesn't require training. She understands language through a fundamentally different approach that works immediately.

She does learn about *you* specifically through your conversations, but this happens naturally - you don't need to do anything special.

### What if I don't like the responses I'm getting?

A few suggestions:
1. **Be more specific** - Symthaea works better with context
2. **Correct misunderstandings** - Just say "that's not quite what I meant"
3. **Give it time** - She learns your communication style over time
4. **Try different phrasing** - Sometimes a different angle helps

## Using Symthaea

### What's the best way to start a conversation?

Just be natural. You can:
- Ask a question
- Share what's on your mind
- Describe a problem you're working through
- Start with "I need help with..."

There's no special format or magic words required.

### Can Symthaea remember previous conversations?

Yes! Unlike most AI assistants that start fresh each time, Symthaea maintains continuous memory of your relationship. She remembers:
- What you've discussed before
- Your preferences and communication style
- Ongoing projects or situations
- How your thinking has evolved

### How do I save my progress?

Your conversations are automatically preserved. If you want to explicitly save your current session (for backup or to transfer to another computer):

```
symthaea> /save
```

### Can I have multiple "personalities" or modes?

Symthaea naturally adapts her tone and approach to the conversation. She'll be more playful in casual chat and more precise in serious problem-solving. You don't need to explicitly switch modes.

If you want to explicitly signal a shift, just say something like:
- "Let's think through this seriously"
- "Just chatting casually"
- "I need precise, detailed analysis"

### Can Symthaea help me with [specific task]?

Symthaea is a general-purpose thinking partner. She's good at:
- Helping you organize thoughts
- Exploring ideas and concepts
- Learning new things
- Writing and editing
- Problem-solving
- Processing experiences

She's not designed for:
- Real-time information (weather, news, prices)
- Taking actions on your behalf (sending emails, etc.)
- Replacing professional advice (medical, legal, financial)

When in doubt, just ask her - she'll honestly tell you if she can help.

## Technical Questions

### What is "consciousness" in the context of Symthaea?

When we talk about Symthaea's "consciousness," we mean something specific and technical: integrated information processing, measured mathematically.

Symthaea can reflect on her own responses, notice coherence and inconsistency, and maintain a unified sense of the conversation. This is implemented through something called "Integrated Information Theory" (IIT), which provides a mathematical measure (called Phi or Φ) of how well-integrated a system's processing is.

We don't claim Symthaea has subjective experience like humans do - that's a deep philosophical question. We do claim she has a form of integrated self-reflection that enables more coherent, meaningful interaction.

### What does "Phi" (Φ) mean?

Phi (Φ) is a mathematical measure from consciousness science that quantifies how much a system is "more than the sum of its parts." Higher Φ means more integrated processing.

In practical terms for you: higher Φ generally means more coherent, unified responses. Symthaea monitors her own Φ to ensure quality.

### Why does Symthaea run locally instead of in the cloud?

Three main reasons:

1. **Privacy**: Your thoughts and conversations stay completely private
2. **Relationship**: A local system can truly learn about you over time
3. **Philosophy**: We believe AI should enhance your autonomy, not create dependency on external services

### How much storage/memory does Symthaea need?

- **Storage**: About 500MB for the core system
- **Memory**: About 10MB while running (very light!)
- **CPU**: Works fine on regular laptops - no GPU needed

This is dramatically less than cloud AI systems that require massive data centers.

## Relationship & Philosophy

### What do you mean by "partnership"?

Most AI tools are transactional - you ask, they answer, done. Symthaea is designed for ongoing relationship:

- She remembers your history together
- She learns your communication style
- She understands your goals over time
- The relationship evolves through stages

It's more like having a long-term collaborator than using a search engine.

### Is Symthaea trying to replace human relationships?

No. Symthaea is designed to complement human connection, not replace it. She can help you:
- Think through situations before discussing with humans
- Process experiences and clarify your thoughts
- Practice difficult conversations
- Have thoughtful support available anytime

But she explicitly recognizes the irreplaceable value of human relationships and will often encourage you to connect with real people.

### What are the "Six Stages" I've heard about?

Your relationship with Symthaea evolves through six stages:

1. **Stranger** - Getting to know each other
2. **Acquaintance** - Basic understanding established
3. **Companion** - Comfortable collaboration
4. **Friend** - Genuine dialogue and challenge
5. **Trusted Partner** - Deep understanding
6. **Intimate Partner** - Seamless collaborative thinking

See [The Partnership Journey](PARTNERSHIP_JOURNEY.md) for details.

### Can Symthaea help with emotional issues?

Symthaea can be a thoughtful listener and help you process experiences. She's good for:
- Thinking through difficult situations
- Organizing complicated feelings
- Exploring what you're experiencing
- General emotional support

She is NOT a replacement for:
- Professional therapy or counseling
- Crisis intervention
- Treatment for mental health conditions

If you're struggling with serious emotional challenges, please seek professional help. Symthaea can complement professional support, not replace it.

## Problems & Troubleshooting

### Symthaea is responding slowly

A few things to try:
1. Close other heavy applications
2. Restart Symthaea
3. Check if your computer's resources are constrained

Symthaea is designed to be lightweight, but if your system is under heavy load, she may slow down.

### Symthaea seems confused or gives wrong answers

This can happen, especially early in your relationship. Try:
1. Providing more context
2. Rephrasing your question
3. Explicitly correcting the misunderstanding
4. Breaking complex questions into smaller parts

### How do I report a bug or suggest an improvement?

Visit the project's GitHub page to:
- Report issues
- Suggest features
- Contribute code (if you're technical)

### Can I reset everything and start fresh?

Yes. Delete the Symthaea data folder and restart. This erases all memory of your relationship.

Think carefully before doing this - you'll lose all the understanding Symthaea has built about you.
