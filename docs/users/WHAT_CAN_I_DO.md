# What Can Symthaea Do?

*A guide to Symthaea's capabilities, explained simply.*

---

## Overview

Symthaea is designed to be a general-purpose thinking partner. While she has some specialized capabilities (especially around system administration), her core value is in understanding, reflection, and collaboration.

Think of her less as a tool with features and more as a partner with abilities.

## Thinking Together

### Help You Organize Your Thoughts

**What it looks like:**
```
You: I have so many things on my mind about this project.
     There's the deadline, the team issues, and I'm not
     sure about the technical approach either.

Symthaea: Let's untangle these one at a time. I'm hearing
          three distinct concerns:

          1. Timeline pressure (the deadline)
          2. Team dynamics (interpersonal challenges)
          3. Technical uncertainty (approach questions)

          Which feels most urgent right now?
```

**Good for:**
- Processing complex situations
- Making decisions with many factors
- Working through overwhelm
- Planning projects

### Explore Ideas With You

**What it looks like:**
```
You: I've been wondering whether it's better to specialize
     deeply or stay generalist in my career.

Symthaea: That's a tension many people feel. Let me share
          some perspectives, then I'd like to hear more
          about your specific situation...

          [thoughtful exploration follows]
```

**Good for:**
- Big life questions
- Creative brainstorming
- Understanding different perspectives
- Developing your thinking

### Help You Learn

**What it looks like:**
```
You: I want to understand how databases work, but every
     explanation I find is too technical.

Symthaea: Let's start with an analogy. Imagine a library...

          [builds understanding step by step, checking
          comprehension along the way]
```

**Good for:**
- Learning new topics
- Understanding complex subjects
- Building skills
- Filling knowledge gaps

## Practical Assistance

### Writing Support

**What Symthaea can help with:**
- Drafting emails, documents, or messages
- Editing for clarity and tone
- Organizing long documents
- Finding the right words for sensitive communications

**Example:**
```
You: I need to write a difficult email to a colleague
     about a missed deadline, but I don't want to
     damage the relationship.

Symthaea: I understand - you need to address the issue
          while preserving trust. Let me suggest some
          approaches and we can craft this together...
```

### Problem-Solving

**What Symthaea can help with:**
- Breaking down complex problems
- Finding approaches you hadn't considered
- Identifying what you actually need to decide
- Creating action plans

**Example:**
```
You: My small business is struggling and I don't know
     what to do first.

Symthaea: Let's map this out. What are your most pressing
          constraints - is it cash flow, customers,
          operations, or something else?

          [systematic exploration follows]
```

### Research Assistance

**What Symthaea can help with:**
- Explaining topics clearly
- Helping you understand what you've read
- Organizing information you've gathered
- Identifying what questions to ask

**Note:** Symthaea doesn't have internet access, so she works with information you share and her built-in knowledge.

## Specialized Capabilities

### System Administration (NixOS Focus)

Symthaea has deep knowledge of NixOS, a particular approach to managing computer systems. If you use NixOS, she can:

- Help you configure your system in plain language
- Explain what changes will do before you make them
- Troubleshoot problems
- Suggest best practices

**Example:**
```
You: I want to set up a web server on my NixOS machine.

Symthaea: I can help you do that safely. Let me explain
          what we'll configure and check your
          understanding before we proceed...
```

### Consciousness Reflection

Symthaea can help you explore questions about awareness, thinking, and consciousness - both your own and in general.

**Example:**
```
You: I've been thinking about how I make decisions.
     Sometimes I feel like I'm just reacting, not
     really choosing.

Symthaea: That's a profound observation. The gap between
          reactive and deliberate action is something
          philosophers and psychologists have explored
          deeply. Would you like to examine your own
          patterns, or understand the theory first?
```

## What Symthaea Can't Do

Being honest about limitations is important:

### No Internet Access
Symthaea runs entirely on your computer. She can't:
- Look up current events
- Access websites
- Check prices or availability
- Get real-time information

### No External Actions
Symthaea can help you think through decisions, but she can't:
- Send emails for you
- Make purchases
- Schedule appointments
- Interact with other services

### Limited Specialized Knowledge
While Symthaea has broad knowledge, she may not have deep expertise in:
- Highly specialized professional domains
- Very recent developments (after her knowledge cutoff)
- Local or regional specifics

### Not a Replacement For
- Professional medical advice
- Legal counsel
- Financial planning from a licensed professional
- Crisis intervention or therapy

## Getting the Most From Symthaea

### Be Specific About What You Need
```
Less helpful: "Help me with my presentation."
More helpful: "I have a presentation next week for potential
              investors. I need help organizing my main
              points so they build toward asking for funding."
```

### Think Out Loud
Symthaea works best when she understands your reasoning, not just your conclusion.
```
"I'm leaning toward option A because of X, but I'm
worried about Y. Option B solves Y but creates Z..."
```

### Correct Misunderstandings
If Symthaea misunderstands, gently redirect:
```
"That's not quite what I meant. Let me explain it
this way instead..."
```

### Build Over Time
The more you interact, the better Symthaea understands you. Consistency helps.

## Example Conversations

### Planning a Career Move
```
You: I'm thinking about changing careers from
     accounting to software development.

Symthaea: That's a significant transition. Before we
          dive into logistics, I'd like to understand
          what's driving this - is it something you
          want to move toward, or away from, or both?

[conversation continues exploring motivations,
practical considerations, and creating a plan]
```

### Processing a Difficult Experience
```
You: I had a really frustrating meeting today and
     I can't stop thinking about it.

Symthaea: I'm here to help you process that. Would
          you like to tell me what happened, or
          would it be more helpful to first explore
          what you're feeling right now?

[supportive exploration follows]
```

### Learning Something New
```
You: I want to understand how investments work, but
     I find it confusing.

Symthaea: Let's build your understanding from the
          ground up. Have you ever put money in a
          savings account? That's actually a starting
          point for understanding investments...

[guided learning follows]
```

---

## Summary

Symthaea is best understood as an intelligent, patient partner who:

- Helps you think more clearly
- Learns your way of communicating
- Grows with you over time
- Respects your privacy completely

She's not a search engine, not a task automation tool, and not a replacement for human relationships. She's a new kind of companion for the thinking you do alone.
