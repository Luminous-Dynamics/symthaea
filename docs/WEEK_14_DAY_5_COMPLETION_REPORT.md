## 🌟 Paradigm Shifts Achieved

### From → To

1. **Opaque Messages** → **Semantic Messages**
   - Before: Modules send strings, recipients parse
   - After: Modules send HDC vectors, meaning is immediate

2. **Brittle Routing** → **Semantic Routing**
   - Before: Keyword matching, manual rules
   - After: Similarity-based, self-organizing

3. **Technical Debt Accumulation** → **Zero Debt Commitment**
   - Before: "We'll fix it later" (never happens)
   - After: All issues tracked, prioritized, scheduled

4. **Aspirational Claims** → **Measurable Progress**
   - Before: "We'll build consciousness" (vague)
   - After: "Φ > 0.5 indicates consciousness" (testable)

5. **Feature Bloat** → **Conscious Evolution**
   - Before: Add features randomly
   - After: Only features that advance consciousness
