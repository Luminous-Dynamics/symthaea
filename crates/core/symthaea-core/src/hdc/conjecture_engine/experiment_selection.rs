//! FEP-flavored active experiment selection: given several live candidate
//! hypotheses that all still fit the data seen so far, choose which
//! experiment to run next by picking the one that maximally *discriminates*
//! between them.
//!
//! This is the second capability in the agreed longer sequence for the
//! Ramanujan Protocol (HDC → constrained physical reasoning → **this** →
//! CfC → IIT). The idea was scoped back when M2 (flux discovery) was still
//! open: "FEP for active experiment selection (choosing initial conditions
//! that maximally discriminate between surviving candidate hypotheses --
//! needs multiple live candidates to discriminate between, which the search
//! doesn't have yet)". M2's factorized search (`flux_discovery.rs`) and the
//! new `typed_generation` module (`symthaea-physics-bridge`) both now
//! routinely produce multiple structurally-diverse surviving candidates, so
//! this capability is buildable.
//!
//! ## Why not reuse `symthaea-fep::ExpectedFreeEnergyComputer` directly
//!
//! `symthaea-fep` already has a real, working expected-free-energy
//! computation (`free_energy.rs`), and its `epistemic_value` there is
//! exactly the right *concept* (uncertainty reduction), but not directly
//! reusable machinery: it computes the entropy of one continuous
//! `HiddenState` before and after a predicted transition under a single
//! `GenerativeModel` -- built for the cognitive loop's own perception-action
//! domain. What this module needs is different: not "how much does one
//! model's own uncertainty shrink," but "how much do *several independent
//! discrete symbolic hypotheses' predictions disagree* for a given
//! experiment" -- the classic optimal-experimental-design / query-by-
//! committee framing, which happens to be the multi-hypothesis analogue of
//! the same FEP epistemic-value idea. `epistemic_value` below is a new,
//! small, honestly-scoped implementation of that analogue, not a
//! reimplementation of `symthaea-fep`'s machinery.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! Deliberately generic over the hypothesis and experiment representations
//! (via a `predict` closure) rather than hardcoded to `Expr` -- this makes
//! it reusable for whatever the next discovery task looks like, not just
//! the closed M2 wave-chain problem. [`epistemic_value`] scores a single
//! candidate experiment; [`select_most_informative_experiment`] picks the
//! best of a candidate pool. `predict` returning `None` for a hypothesis
//! (e.g. the expression is undefined/non-finite at that experiment) means
//! that hypothesis contributes no signal for this experiment, not that the
//! experiment is uninformative -- it's simply excluded from that
//! experiment's variance computation.

/// Population variance (not sample variance -- deliberate: this scores
/// *disagreement across the hypothesis set itself*, not an estimate of a
/// variance parameter from a sample of some larger population).
