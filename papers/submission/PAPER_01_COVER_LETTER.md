Dear Editors,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled "**The Master Equation of Consciousness: A Unified Five-Component Framework**" for consideration as an Article in *Nature Neuroscience*.

## Summary

Consciousness science has produced multiple successful theories—Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace Theory, and Higher-Order Thought theory—yet these remain fragmented across incompatible frameworks. We present the first complete mathematical unification:

**C = min(Φ, B, W, A, R)**

where five components—Integration (Φ), Binding (B), Workspace (W), Attention (A), and Recursion (R)—jointly determine consciousness level. The minimum function ensures that deficiency in any component limits overall consciousness.

## Key Contributions

1. **Theoretical Unification**: First mathematical synthesis of major consciousness theories into a single computational framework

2. **Empirical Validation**: Strong correlation with neural measurements across sleep stages (r = 0.79), 90.5% accuracy distinguishing disorders of consciousness

3. **Mechanistic Insight**: The framework reveals Attention (A) as the primary bottleneck, collapsing 7-fold at sleep onset—providing earlier warning of consciousness changes than integration-based metrics

4. **Clinical Application**: Principled criteria for consciousness assessment applicable to non-communicative patients and AI systems

## Significance for Nature Neuroscience

This work addresses a core challenge in neuroscience: understanding the neural mechanisms of conscious experience. Our findings:

- Transform consciousness from philosophical puzzle to quantifiable phenomenon
- Provide immediately applicable clinical tools for disorders of consciousness
- Establish testable predictions spanning sleep, anesthesia, psychedelics, and brain lesions
- Offer principled framework for assessing consciousness in biological and artificial systems

The manuscript includes novel empirical validation using EEG-derived component estimates, demonstrating that the minimum function outperforms alternative aggregation methods (product, geometric mean, weighted sum) across all metrics tested.
