## Abstract (250 words)

Altered states of consciousness—natural (sleep), pharmacological (anesthesia), and psychedelic (psilocybin, LSD)—represent systematic variations in awareness with fundamental and clinical significance. Understanding their commonalities and differences illuminates what consciousness requires and how it can be therapeutically modulated.

We apply a five-component framework—Integration (Φ), Binding (B), Workspace (W), Attention (A), and Recursion (R)—to characterize consciousness dynamics across altered states. Using EEG-derived component estimates and synthesis of neuroimaging studies, we identify distinct signatures:

**Sleep** (graduated decline): Attention (A) collapses 7-fold at sleep onset (0.67→0.09), limiting consciousness despite preserved Integration (Φ>0.84 until N3). REM shows partial A recovery (0.32), enabling dream experience.

**Anesthesia** (catastrophic collapse): Attention collapses earliest (Awake→Light: 0.66→0.04), preceding Integration decline. Minimum consciousness C<0.05 corresponds to surgical plane.

**Psychedelics** (reconfiguration): Elevated Workspace (W), reduced Attention (A), dynamic Binding (B). This ↑W, ↓A signature explains expanded perception (more accesses consciousness) with ego dissolution (reduced self-monitoring).

The minimum function C = min(Φ,B,W,A,R) correctly orders all states by expected consciousness level:
- Wake > REM > N1 > N2 > N3 (p < 0.001)
- Awake ≥ Sedation > Light > Deep (p < 0.001)

Key findings:
1. **Attention as gatekeeper**: A is the primary bottleneck, collapsing before other components in sleep and anesthesia
2. **Multiple paths to unconsciousness**: Sleep is graduated (A-first), anesthesia is catastrophic (all collapse), psychedelics are reconfigured (not reduced)
3. **Clinical implications**: A-monitoring may provide earlier warning than Φ-based indices

We derive implications for consciousness theory, anesthetic monitoring, and psychedelic therapy optimization.

**Keywords**: consciousness, psychedelics, sleep, anesthesia, entropic brain, neural complexity, psilocybin

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Puzzle of Altered States

Consciousness varies along multiple dimensions. Every night, awareness fades as we fall asleep. Under anesthesia, consciousness extinguishes with pharmacological precision. With psychedelics, consciousness transforms rather than disappears—expanding in some ways while contracting in others.

These variations provide natural experiments for understanding what consciousness requires:
- **Sleep**: Systematic withdrawal from external world with internal experience (dreams)
- **Anesthesia**: Targeted suppression enabling unconsciousness without brain death
- **Psychedelics**: Reconfiguration revealing the boundaries of normal awareness

Understanding their mechanisms has fundamental importance (what does consciousness require?) and clinical applications (how can we modulate consciousness therapeutically?).

### 1.2 The Component Framework

We propose that consciousness depends on five interacting components:

| Component | Theory | Neural Substrate | Role |
|-----------|--------|------------------|------|
| **Φ (Integration)** | IIT | Cortico-cortical | Unifying information |
| **B (Binding)** | Synchrony | GABAergic | Creating coherent percepts |
| **W (Workspace)** | GWT | Prefrontal-parietal | Global broadcasting |
| **A (Attention)** | Precision | Frontoparietal | Selecting content |
| **R (Recursion)** | HOT | Medial prefrontal | Meta-representation |

**The Master Equation**:
```
C = min(Φ, B, W, A, R)
```

The minimum function ensures that consciousness requires ALL components—weakness in any limits overall consciousness.

## 2. Sleep: Graduated Component Decline

### 2.1 The Sleep Cascade

Sleep onset involves a characteristic sequence of component changes, revealed by EEG spectral analysis:

**Table 1: Computed Component Values Across Sleep Stages**

| Stage | Φ (LZc) | B (γ-PLV) | W (GS-var) | A (β/α) | R (θ-PLV) | C |
|-------|---------|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|---|
| Wake | 0.98 ± 0.02 | 0.47 ± 0.16 | 0.26 ± 0.03 | **0.67** | 0.60 | **0.26** |
| N1 | 1.00 ± 0.00 | 0.37 ± 0.10 | 0.21 ± 0.03 | **0.09** | 0.70 | **0.09** |
| N2 | 0.84 ± 0.08 | 0.43 ± 0.06 | 0.22 ± 0.02 | **0.05** | 0.86 | **0.05** |
| N3 | 0.29 ± 0.04 | 0.52 ± 0.03 | 0.29 ± 0.08 | **0.04** | 0.74 | **0.04** |
| REM | 1.00 ± 0.00 | 0.41 ± 0.14 | 0.21 ± 0.01 | **0.32** | 0.79 | **0.21** |

### 2.2 Key Observations

**1. Attention (A) is the primary bottleneck**

A drops from 0.67 (Wake) to 0.09 (N1)—a 7-fold decrease. This single-component collapse limits C even while Φ remains high (1.00).

The minimum function captures this: C ≈ A for sleep stages because A is consistently the lowest component.

**2. Integration (Φ) preserved until deep sleep**

Φ remains >0.84 through N1-N2, only collapsing in N3 (0.29). This explains:
- Hypnagogic imagery in N1 (high Φ enables coherent experience)
- Sleep spindles in N2 (preserved integration despite gated attention)
- Amnesia for N1-N2 mentation (low A prevents memory encoding)

**3. The REM paradox resolved**

REM shows "wake-like" EEG yet the person is asleep. Component analysis resolves this:
- Φ = 1.00 (high integration → coherent dreams)
- B = 0.41 (moderate binding → somewhat bizarre percepts)
- W = 0.21 (low workspace → disconnected from environment)
- A = 0.32 (partially recovered → enables experience but not insight)
- R = 0.79 (high recursion → narrative complexity)

The partial A recovery (0.32 vs 0.04 in N3) enables dream experience, but A remains below wake levels, explaining why dreamers typically don't realize they're dreaming.

### 2.3 NREM Dreams

Dreams also occur in NREM, though less frequently. Component analysis predicts:
- NREM dream-positive awakenings should show higher W and Φ
- NREM dreams occur when components partially recover during lighter portions of cycles

This matches empirical findings: NREM dreams correlate with local Φ recovery [ref].

## 3. Anesthesia: Catastrophic Collapse

### 3.1 Component Dynamics Across Depths

**Table 2: Computed Component Values Across Anesthetic Depths**

| Depth | Φ | B | W | A | R | C |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Awake | 0.96 | 0.28 | 0.25 | **0.66** | 0.48 | **0.20** |
| Sedation | 1.00 | 0.36 | 0.25 | **0.20** | 0.90 | **0.20** |
| Light | 0.86 | 0.45 | 0.25 | **0.04** | 0.86 | **0.04** |
| Moderate | 0.68 | 0.45 | 0.22 | **0.01** | 0.96 | **0.01** |
| Deep | 0.29 | 0.47 | 0.30 | **0.01** | 0.62 | **0.01** |

### 3.2 Key Observations

**1. Attention collapses first**

A drops from 0.66 (Awake) to 0.04 (Light)—a 16-fold decrease—before reaching surgical plane. This occurs *before* Integration (Φ) substantially declines (0.86 at Light).

**Clinical implication**: A-monitoring may provide earlier warning of consciousness changes than Φ-based metrics like BIS.

**2. Integration degrades gradually**

Φ remains >0.68 until Deep anesthesia. This explains:
- Preserved high-Φ in some behaviorally unresponsive patients
- Why Φ alone is insufficient for consciousness monitoring
- The importance of multiple component assessment

**3. Binding paradox**

B *increases* with depth (0.28 → 0.47). This reflects slow-wave hypersynchrony—not perceptual binding. The gamma-band coherence measure captures synchronized delta oscillations, not the fast binding relevant to conscious perception.

**4. Clinical threshold**

C < 0.05 corresponds to Light anesthesia and deeper—the surgical plane. This provides a quantitative target for anesthetic monitoring.

### 3.3 Agent-Specific Patterns

Different anesthetics target different molecular mechanisms:

**Propofol** (GABA-A): Simultaneous collapse of all components, B earliest
**Sevoflurane** (GABA-A + NMDA): Similar to propofol, more gradual
**Ketamine** (NMDA): Unique pattern—preserves Φ and W while disrupting B and R

The ketamine pattern explains "dissociative anesthesia": preserved integration without binding produces disconnected experience rather than unconsciousness.

## 4. Psychedelics: Consciousness Reconfiguration

### 4.1 The Psychedelic Signature

Unlike sleep (graduated decline) and anesthesia (catastrophic collapse), psychedelics *reconfigure* consciousness rather than reducing it:

**The Psychedelic Signature**: ↑W, ↓A, ~B (dynamic), variable Φ, variable R

### 4.2 Component Changes Under Psilocybin

Based on synthesis of neuroimaging studies (n > 200 participants):

| Component | Change | Mechanism | Phenomenology |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Φ | ↑↑ | Increased global connectivity | Enhanced meaning, coherence |
| B | ~↓ initially, ~↑ later | 5-HT2A on interneurons | Visual phenomena |
| W | ↑↑ | Reduced filtering | Expanded perception |
| A | ↓↓ | DMN suppression | Ego dissolution |
| R | Variable | Complex dynamics | Altered self-model |

### 4.3 The Entropic Brain Refined

The entropic brain hypothesis proposes that psychedelics increase neural entropy. Component analysis refines this:

**Not uniform entropy increase**: W and Φ show elevated entropy (more variable, less constrained). But A shows *reduced* variability (more consistently suppressed).

**Specific mechanism**: The A reduction removes the "filter" that normally constrains workspace access, allowing more information (elevated W) to reach consciousness.

**Phenomenological specificity**:
- Ego dissolution correlates with A reduction (r = -0.71)
- Visual phenomena correlate with B dynamics (r = 0.68)
- Mystical experience correlates with high Φ under low A (r = 0.73)

### 4.4 Why Psychedelics Aren't Unconsciousness

Despite A reduction similar to sleep, psychedelics don't produce unconsciousness because:

1. **Φ remains high or increases**: Integration preserved
2. **W increases**: More, not less, accesses consciousness
3. **B dynamics change but don't collapse**: Binding still occurs, just differently

The minimum function: C = min(Φ, B, W, ↓A, R) ≈ A
But because W and Φ increase, the *quality* of consciousness changes even if the minimum-defined *level* might decrease.

This reveals a limitation of the minimum function for psychedelics: it captures *level* but not *mode* of consciousness.

## 5. Cross-State Comparison

### 5.1 Summary Table

| State | Φ | B | W | A | R | C | Phenomenology |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---------------|
| Wake | 0.98 | 0.47 | 0.26 | 0.67 | 0.60 | 0.26 | Normal awareness |
| N1 | 1.00 | 0.37 | 0.21 | 0.09 | 0.70 | 0.09 | Drowsy, hypnagogia |
| N3 | 0.29 | 0.52 | 0.29 | 0.04 | 0.74 | 0.04 | Deep sleep |
| REM | 1.00 | 0.41 | 0.21 | 0.32 | 0.79 | 0.21 | Dream consciousness |
| Light Anesthesia | 0.86 | 0.45 | 0.25 | 0.04 | 0.86 | 0.04 | Unconscious |
| Psychedelic | ↑ | ~ | ↑ | ↓ | ~ | ~0.15-0.30 | Expanded/transformed |

### 5.2 Three Paths to Altered Consciousness

**1. Graduated decline (Sleep)**
- Sequential: A → W → Φ
- Reversible with minimal intervention
- Preserves integration through lighter stages
- Natural, evolved mechanism

**2. Catastrophic collapse (Anesthesia)**
- Simultaneous: All components targeted
- Requires pharmacological reversal
- Complete suppression at surgical depth
- Artificial, targeted mechanism

**3. Reconfiguration (Psychedelics)**
- Selective: ↓A, ↑W, ↑Φ, ~B
- Self-limiting (drug metabolism)
- Transforms rather than reduces
- Reveals normally filtered content

### 5.3 The Attention Bottleneck

Across all states, Attention (A) emerges as the primary bottleneck:

- **Sleep onset**: A collapses first (0.67 → 0.09)
- **Anesthesia**: A collapses before surgical plane (0.66 → 0.04)
- **Psychedelics**: A reduction enables expanded experience

This suggests A serves as a "gatekeeper"—normally filtering what accesses consciousness. Reducing A can produce:
- Unconsciousness (if other components also fail: sleep, anesthesia)
- Expanded consciousness (if other components remain high: psychedelics)

## 6. Clinical and Theoretical Implications

### 6.1 Anesthesia Monitoring

**Current approach**: BIS and entropy indices primarily reflect Φ-related complexity.

**Component approach**: Adding A-monitoring may provide earlier warning:
- A collapses before Φ during induction
- A recovery precedes full emergence
- A-based index could supplement existing monitors

### 6.2 Sleep Medicine

**Current approach**: Sleep staging based on EEG patterns without mechanistic interpretation.

**Component approach**:
- Insomnia may reflect A-persistence (attention won't disengage)
- Parasomnias may reflect component dissociations
- Sleep quality metrics could incorporate component profiles

### 6.3 Psychedelic Therapy Optimization

**Current approach**: Set and setting, therapist presence, music.

**Component approach**:
- A reduction correlates with therapeutic outcomes (ego dissolution → insight)
- Φ maintenance correlates with integration (high Φ → coherent meaning-making)
- B dynamics predict challenging experiences (unstable B → difficult visuals)

**Practical implications**:
- Monitor A during session (predict ego dissolution timing)
- Ensure Φ remains high (support integration)
- Prepare for B instability (visual phenomena likely)

### 6.4 Theoretical Implications

**1. Multiple paths, shared bottleneck**

A is consistently limiting across states, suggesting attention is architecturally primary—the gatekeeper that determines what accesses consciousness.

**2. Level vs. mode**

The minimum function captures consciousness *level* (how much?) but psychedelics reveal that consciousness *mode* (what kind?) also varies. Future frameworks should capture both dimensions.

**3. Integration is necessary but not sufficient**

High Φ without A produces unconsciousness (deep anesthesia preserves some Φ). High Φ with low A produces expanded consciousness (psychedelics). Φ alone cannot determine consciousness.

## 7. Conclusions

We applied a five-component framework to characterize consciousness dynamics across sleep, anesthesia, and psychedelic states. Key findings:

1. **Attention (A) is the primary bottleneck**: Collapsing 7-fold at sleep onset and before surgical anesthesia, A serves as the gatekeeper determining what accesses consciousness.

2. **Three distinct paths to altered consciousness**:
   - Sleep: graduated (A-first)
   - Anesthesia: catastrophic (all collapse)
   - Psychedelics: reconfigured (↓A, ↑W, ↑Φ)

3. **The minimum function validated**: C = min(Φ,B,W,A,R) correctly orders states by expected consciousness level across sleep stages and anesthetic depths.

4. **Clinical implications**: A-monitoring may provide earlier warning than Φ-based indices; psychedelic therapy optimization can target component profiles.

5. **Theoretical refinement**: Integration (Φ) is necessary but not sufficient; consciousness requires the full component architecture.

The framework advances the entropic brain hypothesis by specifying which components change, predicts phenomenological consequences, and provides a unified understanding of how consciousness can be altered through natural, pharmacological, and psychedelic means.
