# Combination Strategy: Publication Packaging for Maximum Impact

**Document Purpose**: Guide strategic combination and packaging of the 15-paper series for different journal tiers, audiences, and impact goals.

---

## Executive Summary

The 15-paper series totals ~72,000 words with 81 figures. Rather than submitting all papers individually (which would fragment attention), we recommend strategic combination into 3-5 major publications plus targeted standalone papers.

## Recommended Combination Strategies

### Strategy A: "Mega-Paper" Approach (Nature/Science)
**Combine**: Papers 01 + 03 + 10 (comparative) + key elements from others

**Title**: "A Unified Framework for Consciousness: Mathematical Formalization, Empirical Validation, and Cross-Domain Applications"

**Target**: Nature or Science (main article + extended online materials)

**Structure**:
- Main text: ~5,000 words (journal limit)
- Extended Data: ~15,000 words with all figures
- Supplementary Materials: Full technical details

**Pros**: Maximum prestige, single citation target
**Cons**: High rejection risk, long review process, loses domain-specific depth

### Strategy B: "Trilogy" Approach (High-Impact Specialty Journals)

**Publication 1: Theory Paper**
- Combine: Papers 01 + 09 + 07
- Title: "The Mathematical Structure of Consciousness: A Five-Component Framework"
- Target: Neuron or Nature Neuroscience
- Words: ~12,000 (within limits for review)

**Publication 2: Empirical Paper**
- Combine: Papers 03 + 05 + 06
- Title: "Empirical Validation of Component Consciousness: From Anesthesia to Psychedelics"
- Target: PNAS or Current Biology
- Words: ~15,000

**Publication 3: Applications Paper**
- Combine: Papers 02 + 14 + 13
- Title: "Consciousness Assessment: AI Systems, Clinical Disorders, and Cross-Species Analysis"
- Target: Nature Machine Intelligence or Phil Trans R Soc B
- Words: ~17,000

**Pros**: Three high-profile citations, covers all domains
**Cons**: Some redundancy in introductions

### Strategy C: "Flagship + Satellites" Approach (RECOMMENDED)

**Flagship (Paper 01)**
- Submit standalone to Nature Neuroscience
- Words: 9,708 (perfect for review article)
- Contains core theory with all components

**Satellite 1: AI Focus**
- Paper 02 standalone to Nature Machine Intelligence
- Words: 6,590

**Satellite 2: Clinical Focus**
- Combine Papers 03 + 14
- Title: "Component-Based Consciousness Assessment: Validation and Clinical Protocol"
- Target: Neurology or JAMA Neurology
- Words: ~11,500

**Satellite 3: Altered States**
- Combine Papers 05 + 06
- Title: "Consciousness Components Across Pharmacological States"
- Target: Neuropsychopharmacology
- Words: ~8,500

**Satellite 4: Theory Integration**
- Combine Papers 04 + 07 + 08
- Title: "Bridging Binding, Global Workspace, and Higher-Order Theories Through Components"
- Target: Trends in Cognitive Sciences
- Words: ~13,700

**Satellite 5: Comparative/Developmental**
- Combine Papers 11 + 13
- Title: "Consciousness Development: Ontogeny and Phylogeny of the Five Components"
- Target: Phil Trans R Soc B or Developmental Science
- Words: ~8,100

**Satellite 6: Technical/Future**
- Combine Papers 09 + 10 + 12 + 15
- Title: "Quantifying Consciousness: Mathematical Foundations, Computational Tools, and Research Agenda"
- Target: PLOS Computational Biology or J Math Psychology
- Words: ~14,500

**TOTAL**: 1 flagship + 6 satellites = 7 publications

**Pros**:
- Flagship stands alone as definitive statement
- Each satellite reaches domain-specific audience
- Multiple citation targets
- Lower rejection risk per paper

**Cons**:
- More administrative overhead
- Some redundancy across papers

### Strategy D: "Maximum Coverage" (All 15 Individual)

Submit all 15 papers to their original target journals:

| Paper | Journal | Impact Factor |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| 01 | Nature Neuroscience | ~28 |
| 02 | Nature Machine Intelligence | ~25 |
| 03 | PNAS | ~12 |
| 04 | Neural Computation | ~3 |
| 05 | Neuropsychopharmacology | ~8 |

## Cross-Reference Strategy

All papers should cite Paper 01 as foundational reference:

```
"We apply the five-component consciousness framework (Author et al., 2025)
which defines consciousness as C = f(Φ, B, W, A, R), where..."
```

Each satellite should cite the flagship and related satellites:

```
"Building on the clinical validation (Author et al., 2025b),
we present a practical assessment protocol..."
```

---

## Figure Sharing Strategy

Some figures can be reused across papers (with permission after acceptance):

**Core figures (from Paper 01) reusable in all**:
- Component overview diagram
- Master equation derivation

**Clinical figures (from Paper 03) reusable in 14**:
- Validation statistics
- Patient examples

**Altered states figures (from Paper 05) reusable in 06**:
- Component trajectory visualizations

---

## Budget for Open Access

If open access preferred, budget approximately:
- Nature journals: $11,000/paper
- PNAS: $3,000
- Specialty journals: $1,500-$4,000
- JOSS: Free
- Some Phil Trans: Covered by institution

**Strategy C budget**: ~$40,000-$60,000 for full OA
**Strategy D budget**: ~$70,000-$90,000 for full OA

---

## Final Recommendation

**Strategy C: Flagship + Satellites** offers the best balance of:
- Impact (flagship in top journal)
- Coverage (domain-specific satellites)
- Manageability (7 publications vs 15)
- Citation ecosystem (all cite flagship)

**Immediate Action**:
1. Polish Paper 01 to submission-ready
2. Submit to Nature Neuroscience
3. Simultaneously submit Paper 02 to Nature Machine Intelligence
4. Begin combining satellites while flagships under review
