## Component Definitions

### Φ (Phi) — Integration

**Definition**: The degree to which information is integrated across the system such that it cannot be reduced to independent parts.

**Theoretical Origin**: Integrated Information Theory (Tononi et al., 2004, 2016)

**Neural Substrate**:
- Long-range cortico-cortical connectivity
- Thalamocortical integration
- White matter tract integrity

**Measurement**:
- Primary: Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI)
- Secondary: Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc)
- Proxy: Mutual information across brain partitions

**What It Captures**: The unity of conscious experience—why we have one unified experiential field rather than disconnected fragments.

**Failure Mode**: Reduced Φ → fragmented or absent experience (e.g., deep anesthesia, severe DOC)

---

### B (Binding)

**Definition**: Temporal synchronization that creates unified representations from distributed feature processing.

**Theoretical Origin**: Binding-by-synchrony hypothesis (Singer & Gray, 1995; Engel & Singer, 2001)

**Neural Substrate**:
- Gamma-band oscillations (30-100 Hz)
- GABAergic interneuron networks
- Cross-regional phase coherence

**Measurement**:
- Primary: Gamma-band phase-locking value (PLV)
- Secondary: Cross-frequency coupling
- Proxy: Kuramoto order parameter

**What It Captures**: How distributed features (color, shape, motion) combine into coherent object representations.

**Failure Mode**: Reduced B → illusory conjunctions, feature misbinding, perceptual fragmentation

---

### W (Workspace)

**Definition**: Global access and broadcast capacity that makes information available to multiple cognitive processes simultaneously.

**Theoretical Origin**: Global Workspace Theory (Baars, 1988; Dehaene & Changeux, 2011)

**Neural Substrate**:
- Prefrontal-parietal network
- Long-range frontoparietal connectivity
- "Ignition" dynamics in distributed networks

**Measurement**:
- Primary: P300 amplitude (especially to oddball stimuli)
- Secondary: Global signal variance with network efficiency weighting
- Proxy: Late (>300ms) ERP components indicating global broadcast

**What It Captures**: What becomes consciously accessible (vs. processed unconsciously). Explains capacity limits, attentional bottleneck.

**Failure Mode**: Reduced W → information processed but not consciously accessible (e.g., subliminal perception, blindsight-like states)

---

### A (Attention)

**Definition**: Precision-weighted selection that determines which content gains priority for workspace access.

**Theoretical Origin**: Attention mechanisms in predictive processing (Feldman & Friston, 2010); Attention Schema Theory elements (Graziano, 2015)

**Neural Substrate**:
- Frontoparietal attention networks (dorsal and ventral)
- Alpha-band dynamics (8-12 Hz) indicating suppression
- Pulvinar and superior colliculus for orienting

**Measurement**:
- Primary: Alpha suppression during attention
- Secondary: Attentional modulation of sensory responses
- Proxy: Performance on attention tasks (e.g., visual search efficiency)

**What It Captures**: How the brain selects relevant information from the overwhelming sensory stream. The "gatekeeper" to the workspace.

**Failure Mode**: Reduced A → distractibility, failure to select relevant information, attentional deficits

**Note**: A (Attention) is DISTINCT from R (Recursion/Meta-cognition). Attention selects content; meta-cognition reflects on content. One can attend without being aware of attending.

---

### R (Recursion / Meta-cognition)

**Definition**: Higher-order representation of one's own mental states, enabling awareness of awareness and self-reflection.

**Theoretical Origin**: Higher-Order Thought theory (Rosenthal, 1997, 2005; Lau & Rosenthal, 2011)

**Neural Substrate**:
- Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
- Anterior cingulate cortex
- Default mode network (for self-referential processing)
- Hippocampal-frontal connectivity (for temporal depth)

**Measurement**:
- Primary: Metacognitive accuracy (confidence-accuracy calibration)
- Secondary: PFC-posterior connectivity during self-referential tasks
- Proxy: Theory of mind task performance; mirror self-recognition

**What It Captures**: The difference between having an experience and knowing you're having an experience. Enables introspection, metacognition, autobiographical memory.

**Failure Mode**: Reduced R → experience without awareness of experience (e.g., blindsight, anosognosia, some psychedelic states)

## Summary Table

| Component | Symbol | Core Concept | Key Measurement | Neural Substrate |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Integration | Φ | Irreducible information | PCI, LZc | Cortico-cortical connectivity |
| Binding | B | Temporal synchrony | Gamma PLV | GABAergic interneurons |
| Workspace | W | Global broadcast | P300 amplitude | Frontoparietal network |
| Attention | A | Precision selection | Alpha suppression | Attention networks |
| Recursion | R | Meta-representation | Metacognitive accuracy | mPFC, DMN |

## Common Confusions to Avoid

### A vs. R

| Attention (A) | Recursion (R) |
|---------------|---------------|
| Selects content | Reflects on content |
| "What do I focus on?" | "What am I experiencing?" |
| Can occur without awareness | Requires higher-order awareness |
| Frontoparietal attention network | Medial PFC, DMN |
| Alpha dynamics | Metacognitive performance |

**Example**: You can attend to a stimulus (high A) without being metacognitively aware that you're attending (low R). Conversely, you can reflect on your mental state (high R) even when attention is diffuse (moderate A).

### W vs. A

| Workspace (W) | Attention (A) |
|---------------|---------------|
| Capacity for broadcast | Selection mechanism |
| "What can be accessed?" | "What is prioritized?" |
| P300 ignition | Alpha suppression |
| Enables reportability | Determines what enters workspace |

**Example**: The workspace has limited capacity (W sets the ceiling). Attention (A) determines what competes for that limited capacity.

### Φ vs. B

| Integration (Φ) | Binding (B) |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Global information integration | Local feature combination |
| Long-range connectivity | Gamma synchrony |
| Unity of experience | Unity of objects |
| Measured by complexity | Measured by coherence |

**Example**: Binding (B) combines color, shape, and motion into "red moving ball." Integration (Φ) combines this object with spatial context, emotional valence, and memory into unified experience.

## Canonical Equation

```
C = min(Φ, B, W, A, R)
```

Consciousness level is limited by the weakest component. This reflects the architectural necessity of each component—consciousness requires:
- Integration (Φ): or experience is fragmented
- Binding (B): or objects are incoherent
- Workspace (W): or content is inaccessible
- Attention (A): or relevant content isn't selected
- Recursion (R): or there's no awareness of experience
