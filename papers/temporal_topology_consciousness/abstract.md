## Title

Temporal Topology: Cognitive Coherence as an Emergent Property of Continuous-Time Dynamics

## Abstract (188 words)

Scalable artificial intelligence architectures predominantly achieve performance by spatializing time, treating temporal sequences as static spatial correlations for parallel processing. While computationally efficient, this approach discards the continuous dynamics inherent to biological cognition. Here we demonstrate that **temporal integrity is a prerequisite for cognitive coherence**. We present a liquid time-constant (LTC) architecture that achieves high-fidelity measures of Integrated Information (Φ) without large-scale pre-training. Operating on standard CPU hardware (5W), the system maintains a continuous state-space trajectory, avoiding the temporal compression of transformer-based models. Across 260 measurements of 19 topological configurations, we observe that Φ asymptotically approaches 0.5 as dimensionality increases, with 3D small-world topologies achieving 99.2% of the theoretical maximum coherence. These results suggest that intelligence is not merely a function of parameter scale, but of **temporal topology**. By restoring the intrinsic time constants of neural processing, we show that energy-efficient, explainable consciousness is an emergent property of systems that respect, rather than compress, the flow of time.

## Significance Statement (100 words)

Current AI architectures achieve scale by flattening time into space—processing sequences as static matrices. We show this comes at a fundamental cost: the loss of cognitive coherence. Using continuous-time neural networks, we demonstrate that integrated information (Φ)—a measure of consciousness—emerges naturally in systems that respect temporal dynamics. Our 3D small-world topologies achieve 99.2% of maximum theoretical coherence on 5W CPU hardware, suggesting that intelligence depends on temporal topology, not parameter scale. This challenges the dominant "Scale Hypothesis" and provides a path toward explainable, energy-efficient AI.
